<h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a product designer with over 3 years of experience in crafting user-centric digital experiences 
    across SaaS, E-commerce, and mobile platforms. My journey has been driven by a passion for creating 
    intuitive and impactful designs that solve real-world problems. I’ve successfully led the design of 
    mobile and web applications, optimizing user flows and enhancing customer satisfaction. With a keen eye 
    for detail, I specialize in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing, which have 
    consistently resulted in measurable improvements, including a 20% boost in customer satisfaction in previous
    projects.</p>


    <p>As I continue my career, I’m expanding my skill set to become a full-stack developer. My current focus is on 
    mastering front-end and back-end technologies to bring a holistic approach to product development. Combining design 
    and development will enable me to build cohesive, end-to-end solutions that not only look great but also perform efficiently. 
    With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap, I am diving into the world of coding to enhance 
    my ability to create seamless digital products from the ground up.</p>

    <p>My goal is to merge the worlds of design and development to create innovative solutions that drive business growth and improve user 
    experiences. As an aspiring full-stack developer, I am committed to continuing my learning journey while leveraging my design background 
    to bring a unique perspective to product development. By understanding both the user’s needs and the technical possibilities, I aim to 
    create solutions that are not only visually appealing but also scalable and efficient.</p>
